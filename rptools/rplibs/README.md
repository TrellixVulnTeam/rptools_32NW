# rplibs

Libraries for rpTools, contains:
* rpSBML
* inchikeyMIRIAM

## rpSBML
Defines SBML structure with additional fields relative to [RetroPath2](https://github.com/brsynth/RetroPath2-wrapper) objects.

<!-- ### Prerequisites
* Python 3 with the following modules:
    * python-libsbml
    * [RDKit](https://www.RDKit.org) -->


### Install
rpLibs is part of rpTools suite:
#### From Conda
```sh
[sudo] conda install -c brsynth -c conda-forge -c bioconda rptools
```

### Test
Please follow instructions below ti run tests:
```
cd tests
pytest -v
```
For further tests and development tools, a CI toolkit is provided in `ci` folder (see [ci/README.md](ci/README.md)).

### Merging
rpSBML class allows the merging between txo rpSBML objects. We use this method to merge an heterologue pathway and a model.

#### Compartments
The compartment of the pathway to each compartment of the model. The comparison is done by ID, name or MIRIAM annotations. If a model compartment matches, then we rename the compartment of each species of the pathway to the name of the model matched compartment. Otherwise, the pathway compartment is added to the model.

## inchikeyMIRIAM
Uses the rrCache to parse an SBML file to find all the chemical species, and try to recover the inchikey and add it to the MIRIAM annotation.
