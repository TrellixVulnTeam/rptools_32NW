# rpThermo

Calculate the formation energy of chemical species and the Gibbs free energy for each reaction and for the heterologous pathway itself. This tool uses the [component contribution](https://gitlab.com/elad.noor/component-contribution) method for determining the formation energy of chemical species that are either not annotated, or cannot be found in the internal database.

For each species, the challenge is to find the corresponding compound in the eQuilibrator cache. To find the good compound, one tries to exact match species ID, InChIKey, InChI or SMILES and stops with the first hit. Then, if no compound has been found, in the last resort, the first part of species InChIKey is looked for within the cache. If the result (a list) is not empty, the first compound is taken.

Because we are interested in the thermodynamics of the pathway when the production of the target is optimized, we have modified coefficients of each reaction. We used a linear system solver (from [SciPy](www.scipy.org)) by giving the reaction that produces the target as objective and elimination of intermediate species as constraints.

## Run

### rpThermo process
**From Python code**
```python
from rptools.rplibs import rpSBML
from rptools.rpthermo import runThermo

pathway = rpSBML(inFile='lycopene/rp_003_0382.sbml').to_Pathway()

runThermo(pathway)

print(pathway.get_thermo_dGm_prime().get('value'))
print(pathway.get_fba_dGm_prime())
```
```bash
>>> -3079.477259696032
>>> {'value': -3079.477259696032, 'error': 7.250256007547839, 'units': 'kilojoule / mole'}
```
**From CLI**
```sh
python -m rptools.rpthermo <input_sbml> <outfile>
```

## Tests
Test can be run with the following commands:

### Natively
```bash
cd tests
pytest -v
```

# CI/CD
For further tests and development tools, a CI toolkit is provided in `ci` folder (see [ci/README.md](ci/README.md)).
